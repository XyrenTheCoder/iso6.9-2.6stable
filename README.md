# iso6.9-2.6stable (debloated)
iso.bot is originally made by notsniped#4573. This is a remix of iso.bot by αrchιshα#5518.

iso6.9 is a Discord bot written in Python and is used to make your Discord experience better! It is similar to iso.bot as it is a remix.

Its prefix is `]`.

(it is normally run in replit)

# Insert token and id before running the code. 
To run it, put the bot token inside:

> token = "token"

Also put your discord id in:

> cid = "client_id"

To get your id, run `?userinfo` or `auserinfo` (slash commands also works) in any servers with Dyno or Arcane and copy your bot's client ID.

In order to use reddit commands, put your Reddit client id and client secret in:

> reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id='reddit_client_id',
                     client_secret='reddit_client_secret',
                     user_agent='idk copied from thatOneArchUser', check_for_async=False)

# Commands (for all versions in this repo)
- Use `]help` to get command list, use `]ahelp` to get alias list.

- Admin commands are included (use `sudo help` to see detailed command list)

***AND MORE COMMANDS WILL BE ADDED! (NOT ALL COMMANDS ARE LISTED HERE)***

# Features
- Successfully transferred some of iso.bot's original commands
